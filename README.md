# Stocks Analysis 

## Overview of Project 
This project analyzes the performance of various green energy stocks over the years 2017 and 2018 in order to determine which stocks are better suited for investment. Through the refactoring of code in VBA for Excel, Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return were calculated for each of the twelves stocks elected. The code was refactored to improve the run time of the script. 

## Results

### Stocks 
Overall, regarding the Yearly Return, the green stocks did significantly better in 2017 than they did in 2018. In 2017, all but one of the stocks saw an increase in Yearly Return, whereas in 2018, all but two of the stocks saw a decrease in Yearly Return. Based on performance, the best stocks to invest in would be "ENPH" and "RUN" since they are the only ones to remain positive from 2017 to 2018. 

### Execution Time
Reagrding the execution time for the refactored code, it ran faster then the original script. 

Execution time for the original script year 2017: 39205.69 seconds [Original Script Execution Time 2017](https://github.com/AmairaniR/stock-analysis/blob/main/resources/Green_Stocks_2017.png)

Execution time for the refactored script year 2017: 0.078125 seconds [Refactored Script Execution Time 2017](https://github.com/AmairaniR/stock-analysis/blob/main/resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)

Execution time for the original script year 2018: 39159.5 seconds [Original Script Execution Time 2018](https://github.com/AmairaniR/stock-analysis/blob/main/resources/Green_stocks_2018.png)

Execution time for the refactored script year 2018: 0.06640625 seconds [Refactored Script Execution Time 2018](https://github.com/AmairaniR/stock-analysis/blob/main/resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

## Summary
-What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 

The advantage of refactoring code is that it forces the person to think of more logical and efficient ways of writing a script in order for it to be more logical, easier to read, and therefore it shortens the execution time. The disadvantage to this is that it may take a long time to refactor the code, all for results that cut the execution time down by fractions of a second. 

-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? 

I think refactoring the original VBA script in this case may have been a disadvantage. It only cut down the execution time down by fractions of a second; something that is truly not noticable by me or most users. It took much longer to refactor and then debug that code than was worth in what was shortened in the execution time.
